--------------------------------
   Steps to run the code :
--------------------------------

$ make

This creates an executable file "assign1_gp15". Use the below command to run the executable.

$ ./test_assign1 

After this, we can check the memory leakage by using the below command

$ valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes ./test_assign1

If the code needs to be run again, we can clean the files and then Redo from Step 1. To clean use below command.

$ make clean
